# The Odin Project - Landing Page

This build was a great opportunity to test my skills and see some new knowledge applied after a year since my Web Development bootcamp. I really enjoyed working in this landing page (and in the whole The Odin Project so far) because everything's focused in enabling the developer to become more and more independent in his journey - this landing page had several instructions still, but there was tons of things to be discovered, and I tried to go beyond applying some hover effects, media queries, utility classes, etc. Hope you enjoy!
